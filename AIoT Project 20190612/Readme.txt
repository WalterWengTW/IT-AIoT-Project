AIoT Health Caring:

This is a project in course of AIoT engineer training. It is a concept of remote health caring.
The core hardware is Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, and other device includes Intel Movidius NCS,
monitor and USB webcam. The first function is using object detection to get hand position, and 
build a function to control to make a vision checking.

Core technology:

1. face Recognition : Haar cascade classifier and CNN face encoding
2. Object Detection : darkflow base Tiny YOLOv2
3. Edge Computing   : Intel Movidius NCSDK API
4. Line Bot Message : Line Bot API
